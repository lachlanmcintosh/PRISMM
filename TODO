can potentially speed up the model by caching the trees and timings and BP_liklihoods for CN SNV combinations. There aren't actually that many and this is probably the bottle neck of the algorithm especially for the more complicated solutions

I am constantly solving the same problem over and over and over again. trees are being made over and over again even though I am constantly repeating them. It would be good to have a database of the timings, branch_lengths, stacked_branch_lengths for every tree and max_epoch combi
    nation. I would like to save this to a database and update the database everytime a tree is not in it. What is a good python library to implement this with given that theree will be many ptyhon programs potentially trying to access and update this database at the same time. can you also give me example code about how to load the database and update it?



main thing to do now is to massively expand the testing suite and get started on continuous integration

NEED TO TEST IN ANALYSE TREES WHETHER OR NOT THE MODEL WAS RECOVERABLE. is the likelihood non zero?
